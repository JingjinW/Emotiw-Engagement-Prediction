## Engagement level prediction

It implements the work in the [EmotiW18 challenge](https://sites.google.com/view/emotiw2018/home). In the engagement intensity prediction task, we win the champion and the details are refered in our paper "Deep Recurrent Multi-instance Learning with Spatio-temporal Features for Engagement Intensity Prediction. International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (ICMIâ€™18), ACM."

### Requirement

* pytorch 0.4.1
* [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose)
* [OpenFace](http://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/)
* [LBPTOP](http://www.cse.oulu.fi/CMV/Downloads/LBPMatlab)

### Remarks

We only provide the code for feature extraction, training and testing. As our deep multi-instance model is still modified for further improvement, we will release the model code soon.
